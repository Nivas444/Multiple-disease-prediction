# Multiple disease prediction
 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is a system that uses ML algorithms to predict the likelihood of multiple health conditions—such as diabetes and heart disease—based on medical data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels, BMI, and more. By training models on historical patient data, the system can identify patterns and risk factors, enabling early diagnosis and personalized healthcare recommendations. Common algorithms used include Logistic Regression and SVM
